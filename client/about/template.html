                    SEMAT Accelerator (a.k.a. <a href="http://task3.cc/projects/sematacc">SematAcc</a>) is a web positioning system for
                    <http://semat.org>
                        SEMAT
                        </a>
                        Essence Theory of Software Engineering.
                </p>
                <p>
                    SematAcc is a response to the lack of practicability of the
                    <a href="http://semat.org/?page_id=28">Essence Theory of Software Engineering</a>
                    .
                    <br/>
                    It provides practical ways to learn the Essence theory, as it enables
                    a web positioning system to represent a software system status using Essence
                    Kernel (currently, only the Concerns, Alphas and the States are supported).
                    <br/>
                    The tool itself serves for multiple use cases. In short, it is an awareness
                    creator, self-positioning system, discussion generator as well as visualization
                    of your project's current state.
                    <br/>
                    SematAcc was also developed with research in mind. It enables research
                    on Essence by logging the events on each State change. It might be employed
                    as a valuable tool for controlled experiments and case studies.
