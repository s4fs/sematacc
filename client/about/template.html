                SEMAT Accelerator (a.k.a. <a href="http://task3.cc/projects/sematacc">SematAcc</a>) is a web positioning
                system for <a href="http://semat.org">SEMAT</a>
                Essence Theory of Software Engineering.
            </p>

            <p>
                SematAcc is a response to the lack of practicability of the
                <a href="http://semat.org/?page_id=28">Essence Theory of Software Engineering</a>
                .
                <br/>
                It provides practical ways to learn the Essence theory, as it enables
                a web positioning system to represent a software system status using Essence
                Kernel (currently, only the Concerns, Alphas and the States are supported).
                <br/>
                The tool itself serves for multiple use cases. In short, it is an awareness
                creator, self-positioning system, discussion generator as well as visualization
                of your project's current state.
                <br/>
                SematAcc was also developed with research in mind. It enables research
                on Essence by logging the events on each State change. It might be employed
                as a valuable tool for controlled experiments and case studies.
